INTRODUCTION
Background of the Study
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and its treatment often relies on a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In recent decades, Deep Regional Hyperthermia (DRH) has emerged as an effective adjunct therapy, in which malignant tissues are selectively heated to temperatures between 40–45 °C to enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents (Wust et al., 2002; van der Zee, 2002). Clinical studies have shown that controlled heating improves treatment outcomes while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
A central challenge in DRH is the accurate delivery of electromagnetic energy to deep-seated tumors. Due to the heterogeneous electrical properties of biological tissues, electromagnetic waves propagate non-uniformly within the human body, making treatment planning a nontrivial problem. As a result, computational electromagnetic modeling has become an essential component of modern hyperthermia treatment planning (Taflove & Hagness, 2005).
Among numerical techniques, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is particularly well-suited for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation in complex, three-dimensional, heterogeneous media. FDTD directly solves Maxwell’s equations in the time domain, allowing detailed prediction of electric and magnetic field distributions within voxel-based anatomical models (Taflove & Hagness, 2005). These field distributions can then be used to compute Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), a key metric that quantifies electromagnetic energy absorption in biological tissues.
Houle and Sullivan (2019) demonstrated the applicability of FDTD to deep regional hyperthermia treatment planning through a three-dimensional simulation example implemented in Python. Their work illustrates how voxelized tissue models, frequency-independent dielectric properties, and absorbing boundary conditions can be combined to generate SAR maps for treatment analysis. While this example effectively demonstrates the feasibility of FDTD-based DRH simulations, it serves primarily as an educational and demonstrative application, rather than a fully extensible, research-oriented framework.
Problem Statement
Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of FDTD for hyperthermia modeling, accessible and transparent simulation frameworks for DRH remain limited. Many existing tools are proprietary or lack open, code-intensive implementations that allow full customization, validation, and extension by researchers. This limitation restricts reproducibility and hampers further development of patient-specific optimization strategies.
Objectives of the Study
This thesis has five main objectives, all focused on developing a code-intensive computational framework for deep regional hyperthermia:
To construct voxel-based, patient-specific tissue models from CT or MRI data, assigning appropriate dielectric and physical properties to each tissue type.
To implement a full 3D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) solver in Python, capable of simulating electromagnetic wave propagation in heterogeneous biological tissue.
To compute voxel-wise Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) distributions, enabling quantitative assessment of electromagnetic energy deposition in tumors and surrounding healthy tissue.
To develop a programmatic antenna optimization framework, adjusting antenna phase, amplitude, and spatial configuration to maximize tumor heating while minimizing unwanted hot spots.
To evaluate the computational performance and scalability of the solver, ensuring feasibility for high-resolution, patient-specific 3D simulations.
Significance of the Study
This study emphasizes the development of a scalable and efficient computational framework rather than direct clinical deployment. By focusing on code transparency, numerical accuracy, and performance evaluation, the proposed work aims to serve as a reproducible research platform for future hyperthermia studies.
Scope and Limitations
This study focuses on frequency-independent tissue models, which are commonly used in clinical hyperthermia simulations due to the narrow operating frequency range of DRH systems (Houle & Sullivan, 2019). Thermal feedback, blood perfusion effects, and frequency-dispersive tissue models are excluded from the current scope and are identified as potential directions for future work.










REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
Review of Related Literature
Deep Regional Hyperthermia (DRH) is a clinically established adjunct cancer therapy that aims to elevate tumor temperatures to approximately 40–45 °C using electromagnetic (EM) energy. At this temperature range, tumor cells become more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy while maintaining acceptable thermal tolerance in surrounding healthy tissues. The effectiveness of DRH strongly depends on accurate energy focusing, making treatment planning a critical component of the therapy process.
Computational electromagnetic modeling has become an essential tool in DRH treatment planning. Among various numerical methods, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method has been widely adopted due to its ability to model transient electromagnetic wave propagation in complex, heterogeneous media. Taflove and Hagness (2005) established FDTD as a robust and versatile technique for solving Maxwell’s equations in three-dimensional domains, particularly for biomedical applications involving lossy dielectric materials such as biological tissues.
Houle and Sullivan (2019) demonstrated the application of FDTD in deep regional hyperthermia treatment planning through voxel-based simulations of electromagnetic field propagation in anatomically realistic tissue models. Their work illustrates how spatially varying tissue properties, such as permittivity and conductivity, can be incorporated into a 3D grid to compute electromagnetic field distributions and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) patterns. The book presents DRH as an application example that integrates FDTD theory, Python implementation, and SAR visualization, providing a clear educational framework for understanding computational hyperthermia modeling.
Several research studies have also employed FDTD-based solvers to analyze SAR distributions in biological tissues for hyperthermia and microwave exposure studies. These simulations often rely on frequency-independent tissue models, where dielectric properties are assumed constant at a fixed operating frequency. This approximation is considered valid for narrowband hyperthermia systems, as the variation of tissue properties over the operating frequency range is relatively small. Frequency-dependent dispersive models, such as Debye or Lorentz formulations, are more commonly used in broadband microwave imaging or spectroscopy applications but are not always necessary for clinical hyperthermia planning.
Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of FDTD for DRH simulations, many existing tools are either proprietary or implemented in closed research environments. Educational examples, such as those presented by Houle and Sullivan (2019), provide valuable insight but are not designed as fully extensible, research-oriented platforms. This creates a gap for a code-intensive, open, and customizable 3D FDTD framework that focuses on transparent implementation, reproducibility, and extensibility for patient-specific DRH treatment planning.

Theoretical Framework
The theoretical foundation of this study is based on Maxwell’s equations, which govern the behavior of electromagnetic fields in space and time. In lossy dielectric media such as biological tissue, these equations are expressed as:


The FDTD method discretizes these equations in both space and time, allowing electric and magnetic field components to be updated iteratively on a three-dimensional Yee grid. This time-stepping approach enables the simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation through heterogeneous tissue structures with spatially varying material properties (Taflove & Hagness, 2005).
To model open-domain electromagnetic propagation, Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) are implemented at the simulation boundaries. PML regions absorb outgoing waves and prevent artificial reflections that could otherwise distort field and SAR calculations. This boundary treatment is essential for accurately modeling hyperthermia applicators and patient geometries in finite computational domains.
The primary output of the electromagnetic simulation is the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which quantifies the rate at which electromagnetic energy is absorbed by tissue. SAR is defined as:

where  is the electrical conductivity,  is the magnitude of the electric field, and  is the tissue mass density. SAR distributions serve as a key metric for evaluating heating effectiveness in tumor regions while monitoring exposure in healthy tissues.
This theoretical framework integrates electromagnetic field theory, numerical methods, and biomedical modeling to support a computational approach for DRH treatment planning. By combining FDTD-based field computation with SAR analysis, the study establishes a foundation for optimizing antenna configurations and improving the precision of deep regional hyperthermia simulations.
